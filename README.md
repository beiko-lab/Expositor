# Expositor

Expositor is a solution that breaks a DNA sequence into fragments using a sliding windows of 58 nucleotides, encodes them using [_pc3mer_](https://github.com/beiko-lab/DNA_encoders#pc3mer) and [_k-mers_](https://github.com/beiko-lab/DNA_encoders#k-mers), and feeds them to the classifier. The  multilayer perceptron classifier outputs the probability for each input sequence to be a promoter. The probabilities are smoothed, so a nucleotide's neighbors' probabilities impact on its probabilitiy that is filtered to limit the minimum length of the promoter predictions. As its last step, the solution outputs a list of the promoter predictions and their position in the DNA sequence.

## Samples used for training

To train the classifier, we used the following samples:
* 1005 experimentally verified promoter samples from RegulonDB, Release 9.4 from 05-08-2017, that were associated with a single σ factor: 65 samples of σ<sup>24</sup>, 9 σ<sup>28</sup>, 58 σ<sup>32</sup>, 103 σ<sup>38</sup>, 17 σ<sup>54</sup> and 753 σ<sup>70</sup> promoters. For all these samples, the sequences including both binding sites and the spacer between them have at most 58 nucleotides. Based on this observation, we subsampled each input sequence to encompass 58 nucleotides taken centered on the spacer to ensure that the whole pair of binding sites are contained in the new sample. 
* 1008 non-promoter samples obtained by mapping the promoter sequences to the [_E. coli_ K-12 MG1655 genome](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000005845.2/) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN; [[1]](#1), [[2]](#2)). All segments in the DNA with length greater than 58 nucleotides and without a match to an identified promoter sequence were considered for the negative data set, which included both protein-coding genes and non-coding intergenic regions. Then, we used a sliding window with 58 bp to create sequences of fixed length and selected 1008 samples that were equally distant from each other along the genome.

## Data sets available

All the samples, raw and encoded sequences, can be found at /data_sets and are explained below. The negative samples are identified as Sigma00, everything else are positive samples, such as Sigma24, Sigma70, etc.

* Raw sequences: (**raw_samples.fasta**) File's few lines as an example:
  ```

     >Sigma00
     GCTGGTTTGTACTACCACAAAGAGATTGGCTCCCGGATTAAAAAAAGTAATCACGAAC
  ```

* Sequences encoded with _pc3mer_: There are twelve physicochemical properties per 3-mers: 
  * Bendability-DNAse, 
  * Bendability-consensus, 
  * Trinucleotide GC Content,
  * Nucleosome positioning, 
  * Consensus_roll, 
  * Consensus_Rigid, 
  * Dnase I, 
  * Dnase I-Rigid, 
  * MW-Daltons, 
  * MW-kg, 
  * Nucleosome, and 
  * Nucleosome-Rigid [3]. 
    
  We generated one file for each one of the physicochemical properties used to encode the sequences into _pc3mer_, and named the file after the property. For instance, **Bendability-consensus.md**. File's few lines as an example:
